SamyangFisheyeDefisher
======================

A defishing script for the Samyang/Falcon/Walimex (and other rebrands) to batch defish all the photos inside a folder. For windows with hugin installed.
 These scripts defish the photos using the panini method (straightens only the vertical lines) or the rectilinear method (straightens both vertical and horizontal lines). The defishing algorithms are extracted from Magic Lantern. So if you use Magic Lantern, the defished image you see in your camera will be exactly the same image you will get with these scripts.

What you need 
======================
- Any Windows version
- Hugin
